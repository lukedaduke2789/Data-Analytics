Final Project: Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the final data analysis project! This repository contains datasets and Python scripts for a thorough exploration of user transactions and their associated behaviors. The goal is to uncover patterns, insights, and actionable conclusions that can be derived from real-world data.
Contents
1. Datasets

    cards_data.csv
    This dataset includes information on user credit/debit card transactions. It contains details such as:
        Card type (credit or debit)
        Transaction amounts
        Merchant categories
        Transaction dates
        It is ideal for analyzing spending habits, high-spend categories, and time-based trends.

    users_data.csv
    This dataset contains user profiles and attributes such as:
        User demographics (age, gender, location)
        Account information
        It is ideal for segmenting users based on demographics and linking user profiles to transaction patterns.

    transactions.csv
    This dataset combines user data with transaction history. It includes:
        User IDs
        Transaction amounts and frequencies
        Categorical tags for transactions
        It serves as a comprehensive source to evaluate user behaviors and their financial activities.

2. Scripts

The repository includes Python scripts for:

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, ensuring consistency, and preparing the data for analysis.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding patterns within the data using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
    Statistical Analysis: Employing techniques such as correlation, hypothesis testing, and statistical summaries.
    Machine Learning Models (Optional): Implementing clustering or classification for user segmentation and prediction.

3. Project Goals

This project aims to:

    Understand user spending habits and merchant preferences.
    Segment users based on their demographic and transactional behaviors.
    Identify trends and anomalies in transactions.
    Predict user behavior based on past data for potential business applications.

4. How to Use

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

Ensure you have Python installed, along with necessary libraries:

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

    Use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to analyze the datasets.

5. Future Work

    Expanding analysis to include predictive modeling for transaction forecasting.
    Adding visualizations for geographic trends in user transactions.
